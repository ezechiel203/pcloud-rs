//! Process-level UNIX signal handling for the pcloud-rs Rust daemon.
//!
//! Scope and design notes
//! ----------------------
//!
//! This module installs a small, dependency-free set of `sigaction(2)` handlers
//! so the daemon can exit gracefully under a service manager (systemd, sysvinit,
//! a bare shell, …) instead of being SIGKILLed after `TimeoutStopSec`.
//!
//! The handlers follow the standard POSIX async-signal-safety rules:
//!
//! - They do **nothing** beyond flipping atomic flags. No heap allocation, no
//!   locking, no logging, no Rust `println!`, no `Mutex`.
//! - `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` set a single `SHUTDOWN_REQUESTED` flag.
//! - `SIGHUP` sets a `RELOAD_REQUESTED` flag; the main loop treats it as a
//!   no-op today (documented; no config reload wired yet) but the flag is
//!   reserved so operators can trigger future reloads without breaking
//!   service contracts.
//! - `SIGPIPE` is explicitly ignored — this is standard for network daemons
//!   that detect broken peer streams through write-error returns.
//!
//! The serve loop is responsible for observing `SHUTDOWN_REQUESTED` and
//! translating it into the existing graceful shutdown path (which drains
//! mounts, flushes audit/upload state, and exits cleanly). We do **not**
//! weaken `SA_RESTART` tuning beyond what is required for `accept(2)` to
//! return `EINTR`; that is the only blocking call on the hot path.
//!
//! ## Drain state machine (graceful-drain protocol)
//!
//! On top of the single shutdown flag the daemon exposes a three-state
//! drain state machine consumed by the serve loop and by the
//! `Method::DrainStatus` IPC surface:
//!
//! ```text
//!     Running ──SIGTERM──▶ Draining ──timeout / flushed──▶ Stopped
//! ```
//!
//! - `Running`: normal dispatch; accept new connections.
//! - `Draining`: new non-status connections are rejected with
//!   `ResponseStatus::Unavailable("daemon draining, retry")`; in-flight
//!   requests are allowed to complete; `DrainStatus` probes continue to
//!   answer so operators can poll progress.
//! - `Stopped`: loop has exited, socket unbound; subsequent reads on the
//!   state are for post-mortem only.
//!
//! The state, the drain start instant, and a `u64` in-flight counter live
//! in a single `AtomicU64`/`AtomicU8` pair so both the dispatch thread
//! (single-threaded today) and any future worker can read them without
//! locking. All operations are async-signal-safe, so the SIGTERM handler
//! can flip the state directly without taking a `Mutex`.
//!
//! Thread safety
//! -------------
//!
//! The three flags are `AtomicBool`. Install is idempotent and internally
//! guarded by a `Once`. Reinstalling over an existing handler is rejected
//! to avoid silent double-registration.

// **PLATFORM:** all
// **GATING:** none (portable).
