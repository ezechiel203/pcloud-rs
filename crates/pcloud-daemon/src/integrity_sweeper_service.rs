// CLAUDEREV iter-1 SYNC-H-04-6 audit (closed in the iter-5 remediation
// loop, fire 24): the original "~50 `.unwrap()` / `.expect()`" header
// claim was inaccurate — the audited file held 0 production `.unwrap()`
// (every `Mutex::lock()` already used `unwrap_or_else(|poisoned| { log;
// poisoned.into_inner() })`) and exactly 2 production `.expect()` sites,
// both on `thread::Builder::spawn` results. Both have been refactored:
//   - `IntegritySweeperShell::spawn_worker` now logs the spawn `io::Error`
//     and gracefully degrades to "sweeper disabled" instead of panicking
//     the entire daemon at startup.
//   - `IntegritySweeperShell::start_schedule` now propagates the spawn
//     `io::Error` via the new `ScheduleError::ThreadSpawn` variant
//     (the function already returned `Result<(), ScheduleError>`).
// Test-module unwrap/expect calls are intentional and idiomatic; they are
// not part of the daemon's runtime panic surface.

//! Background-integrity-sweeper daemon service (H14d).
//!
//! ## Purpose
//!
//! Wire together the configuration scaffolding shipped by H14a
//! ([`pcloud_config::integrity_sweeper`]), the sweep engine in
//! `pcloud_fs::integrity_sweeper`, and the daemon's existing audit and
//! IPC surfaces. Exposes a stable [`IntegritySweeperShell`] the runtime
//! borrows mutably during IPC dispatch, plus the audit-detail formatter
//! the parity-proof harness greps for, **and** a cron-driven scheduler
//! that honours the `schedule_cron` / `pause_on_battery` config keys.
//!
//! ## Security posture
//!
//! - Every [`IntegrityEvent::Mismatch`] is recorded through the
//!   tamper-evident audit log ([`pcloud_store::append_audit_event`]) with
//!   the raw path replaced by a SHA-256 `path_hash`.
//! - Audit write failures are **never silently dropped**; they increment
//!   [`IntegritySweeperShell::audit_drop_count`] (audit invariant M1).
//! - The sweeper is **disabled by default** at config load time; an
//!   operator must set `[features.integrity_sweeper] enabled = true`.
//! - The disabled shell is a no-op that responds with a stable
//!   "not enabled" IPC reply, never `InvalidRequest`.
//!
//! ## Scheduler + battery hooks
//!
//! - `schedule_cron` is parsed on startup via the `cron` crate and a
//!   dedicated scheduler thread (`pcloudd-integrity-scheduler`) sleeps
//!   until the next boundary, then invokes
//!   [`IntegritySweeperShell::run_once`]. An invalid cron expression
//!   refuses to start the scheduler and surfaces through the
//!   [`IntegritySweeperShell::from_config`] / `start_schedule` error
//!   path — the sweeper never silently runs on an unparseable schedule.
//! - `pause_on_battery` gates the scheduler tick: before each run the
//!   scheduler consults a [`PowerSource`]. On Linux the default reader
//!   scans `/sys/class/power_supply/*/status`; on macOS/Windows it uses
//!   the `battery` crate. When any supply reports `Discharging` (or
//!   equivalent) the tick is skipped and the scheduler emits a
//!   structured `integrity_sweeper.paused{reason="on_battery"}` line.
//!   Unsupported platforms log a one-shot warning and behave as if the
//!   flag were disabled.
//!
//! ## Honest limitations
//!
//! - **Self-contained event type.** This module defines its own
//!   [`IntegrityEvent`] rather than depending on
//!   `pcloud_plugin_api::FileIntegrityResult`; the daemon has no
//!   `pcloud-plugin-api` dependency by design (see module code).
//! - **Real walker integrated.** [`IntegritySweeperShell::run_once`]
//!   walks every configured sweep root using
//!   `pcloud_fs::integrity_sweeper::IntegritySweeper::sweep`, computes
//!   local SHA-256 for each file, fetches remote SHA-256 via the
//!   [`DaemonChecksumFetcher`] trait, compares digests, and pipes
//!   resulting [`IntegrityEvent`]s through the worker channel for audit.
//!
//! ### Original notes
//!
//! This module is **deliberately self-contained**:
//!
//! - it owns its own [`IntegrityEvent`] type rather than depending on
//!   the plugin-api crate (the daemon has no `pcloud-plugin-api`
//!   dependency, and reusing that wire type would couple two unrelated
//!   parity surfaces);
//! - it owns its own `mpsc` channel, worker thread, progress accumulator,
//!   and skip-list reload primitive;
//! - it ships a stable `IntegritySweeperShell` API that the runtime
//!   borrows mutably during IPC dispatch.
//!
//! ## Walker integration
//!
//! [`IntegritySweeperShell::run_once`] walks all configured sweep roots
//! (set via [`IntegritySweeperShell::set_sweep_roots`]) using the
//! `pcloud_fs::integrity_sweeper::IntegritySweeper` engine. For each
//! file it computes the local SHA-256, fetches the remote SHA-256 via
//! the [`DaemonChecksumFetcher`] trait (set via
//! [`IntegritySweeperShell::set_checksum_fetcher`]), and compares. The
//! resulting events are translated to daemon-level [`IntegrityEvent`]s
//! and piped through the worker channel. Mismatches are audited,
//! Ok/Throttled events update progress counters. The cron scheduler
//! uses the same walk-and-compare codepath.
//!
//! ## Audit invariant
//!
//! Every `Mismatch` event flows through `record_mismatch_audit` which
//! calls into the daemon's tamper-evident audit log
//! ([`pcloud_store::append_audit_event`]). The audit row carries a
//! BLAKE3-over-path "path hash" rather than the raw path so the audit
//! stream stays redacted under the H1 secret-handling rules. Local /
//! remote SHA256 hex digests are non-secret content fingerprints and are
//! safe to store verbatim.
//!
//! `Ok` events drop silently. `Throttled` events bump a metric counter
//! so operators can see when the rate limiter is biting.

// **PLATFORM:** all
// **GATING:** none (portable).
