//! Per-session, per-category IPC rate limiter.
//!
//! The dispatcher classifies every decoded [`pcloud_ipc::Request`] into a
//! [`pcloud_config::rate_limit::RateCategory`] before invoking the
//! backend. A per-category token bucket (configured via
//! [`pcloud_config::rate_limit::RateLimitPolicy`]) decides whether the
//! request proceeds or is rejected with [`pcloud_ipc::ResponseStatus::Conflict`]
//! and a "retry after Ns" message. Rate-limit rejection is **never** an
//! internal-error path — the caller sees a deterministic "conflict,
//! retry later" response.
//!
//! Rationale: an audit against the Rust rewrite noted that expensive
//! operations (bulk public-link listing, integrity run-once, snapshot
//! create) had no IPC-layer limiter, so a chatty or hostile client
//! could DoS the daemon by fan-out. This module closes that gap.
//!
//! Per-peer granularity is provided by [`PerPeerRateLimiter`] which
//! maintains a `HashMap<peer_uid, SessionRateLimiter>`. Each distinct
//! peer uid gets its own independent token-bucket state so one client
//! hammering the daemon cannot starve another. The underlying
//! [`SessionRateLimiter`] is a plain token-bucket container and knows
//! nothing about peer identity on its own.

// **PLATFORM:** all
// **GATING:** none (portable).
