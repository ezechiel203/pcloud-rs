//! FUSE write path (bd-1du.4.d).
//!
//! Implements `create` / `write` / `flush` / `fsync` / `setattr`(truncate)
//! / `unlink` / `rename` on top of the disk-backed staging dir and the
//! write-ahead journal. Uploads themselves are delegated to an abstract
//! [`FileUploadBackend`] so that tests do not require a real transport and
//! so the daemon can wire the real `pcloud-proto::transfer_api` in 4.e.
//!
//! # Concurrency contract
//!
//! Per-inode state (staging blob, pending byte counter, dirty flag) is
//! locked with a `Mutex`. The `WriteBackService` holds a `Mutex<HashMap>`
//! indexed by inode. Concurrent writes to **different** inodes proceed in
//! parallel; concurrent writes to the **same** inode serialise through the
//! inode mutex — matching POSIX file-lock semantics on a single file
//! descriptor.
//!
//! # Flush policy
//!
//! Writeback is triggered by any of:
//!
//! * explicit FUSE `flush` / `fsync` on the inode,
//! * accumulated dirty-byte count reaches `flush_threshold_bytes`,
//! * wall-clock time since last flush exceeds `flush_interval`.
//!
//! The daemon mount loop is responsible for periodically calling
//! [`WritePathService::tick`] to enforce the time-based flush; the size
//! bound is checked on every `write`.
//!
//! # Atomic write protocol (P1.2)
//!
//! Every accepted FUSE `write` is made durable via a write-ahead
//! journal before any visible mutation. The ordering is strict:
//!
//! 1. **Append** a [`JournalRecord`] describing the op
//!    ([`JournalOp::Write`], [`JournalOp::Truncate`],
//!    [`JournalOp::Create`], [`JournalOp::Unlink`],
//!    [`JournalOp::Rename`]) to the journal file with a CRC32 tail.
//! 2. **`fsync(file)`** the journal file descriptor so the record
//!    bytes reach platter.
//! 3. **`fsync(dir)`** the journal's parent directory so the directory
//!    entry is durable — skipping this step means a post-crash `readdir`
//!    may fail to find a freshly-created journal segment, silently
//!    dropping acknowledged writes (POSIX allows this). This is the
//!    `fsync(file)+fsync(dir)` discipline required by P1.2.
//! 4. **Apply** the op to the in-memory staging blob and bump the
//!    per-inode dirty byte counter.
//! 5. **Acknowledge** the FUSE write to the kernel.
//!
//! Crash between steps 1–3 is safe: the unacknowledged record is
//! either absent (step 1 not flushed) or replayable (step 2/3 flushed
//! but step 4 lost). Replay is idempotent because every record carries
//! a monotonically increasing LSN and the staging apply is
//! content-addressed per `(ino, offset, len)`.
//!
//! Writeback to the backend is a separate, later transaction: once
//! the backend returns `200 OK` for an upload the journal segment is
//! truncated under another `fsync(dir)` barrier so a crash mid-upload
//! re-executes the upload on the next boot rather than losing data.
