//! Process-wide SLO observation hook for the FUSE read path and the
//! integrity-sweeper scheduler loop.
//!
//! The FUSE adapter in `platform/linux.rs` is constructed by the `fuser`
//! crate, not by the daemon directly, so there is no natural place to
//! thread an `Arc<Slo>` through `fn read`. This module exposes a
//! [`set_slo_registry`] entry point the daemon calls once at boot to
//! install the shared [`pcloud_observability::slo::Slo`] registry, plus
//! zero-cost [`observe_mount_read`] / [`observe_integrity_sweeper_run`]
//! / [`observe_audit_chain_verify`] helpers that the relevant hot paths
//! call on completion.
//!
//! The same registry backs `Method::GetSlo` and the `/slo` HTTP endpoint
//! on the daemon.
//!
//! When no registry is installed (unit tests, early boot, non-daemon
//! consumers) `observe_mount_read` is a no-op — there is no dependency on
//! the daemon being fully bootstrapped before the FUSE adapter handles
//! its first read.
//!
//! # Why not inject through the adapter?
//!
//! The `fuser::Filesystem` trait is consumed by value by the background
//! session, and the adapter is boxed through [`crate::fuse_adapter`]
//! which already has a fixed interface used by tests. A process-wide
//! `OnceLock<Arc<Slo>>` keeps the wiring non-invasive: the adapter is
//! unchanged, the daemon owns registration, and a single read path
//! branch (a nullary load of an `AtomicPtr`) is the only hot-path cost.
//!
//! # Platform
//!
//! **PLATFORM:** all (the hook compiles on every OS). The hot call site
//! is Linux-only today because only `platform/linux.rs` contains a real
//! FUSE `read` shim.
//!
//! **GATING:** none.
