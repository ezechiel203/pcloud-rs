//! **PLATFORM: Windows only.**
//! **GATING: `#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]`** -- the entire module file
//! is gated at the `mod windows;` line in `platform/mod.rs`.
//!
//! ============================================================================
//!  FSP_FILE_SYSTEM dispatcher for WinFSP 2.x. Native CI owns a strict live
//!  read/write/unmount smoke test; account-backed mount qualification remains
//!  a separate release gate.
//!
//!  This file wires `FspFileSystemCreate` / `SetMountPoint` /
//!  `StartDispatcher` into the [`PlatformMount`] seam and returns a real
//!  [`MountHandle`] whose Drop calls `StopDispatcher` + `Delete` and
//!  reclaims the leaked adapter box. The callback surface is implemented for
//!  normal file and directory I/O. Passing native CI is the evidence for the
//!  WinFSP ABI; this source comment alone is not a qualification claim.
//!
//!  Before any claim of Windows parity (`bd-1du.4` / `bd-1du.10`):
//!   1. Build the crate with `--target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.
//!   2. Install the WinFSP 2.x MSI (https://winfsp.dev/) and verify
//!      `winfsp-x64.dll` is on `%PATH%`.
//!   3. Validate struct sizes / field offsets against the installed
//!      `winfsp/fsctl.h` and `winfsp/winfsp.h`.
//!   4. Exercise mount/read/write/unmount under the strict Windows live gate.
//!   5. Confirm signal-equivalent teardown (CTRL-C / service stop) actually
//!      cleans the mount point.
//!
//! ============================================================================
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The Windows adapter mirrors the Linux shape (`LinuxPlatformMount` +
//! `fuser::Filesystem` shim): a thin [`PlatformMount`] implementation plus a
//! callback-table shim that converts WinFSP's NT semantics into the
//! cross-platform [`FuseAdapter`] trait the backends already implement.
//!
//! WinFSP semantic mapping (MVP):
//!
//! * **Open / Create merge lookup+open.** WinFSP's `Open` receives the full
//!   NT path; the shim resolves it through [`FuseAdapter::lookup`] and
//!   returns a file context pointer that carries the adapter's
//!   `FileHandleId`. `Create` asks the backend to materialize a new entry.
//! * **Cleanup handles delete-on-close.** WinFSP calls `Cleanup` with the
//!   `FspCleanupDelete` flag when the NT `FILE_DELETE_ON_CLOSE` disposition
//!   is set; the shim then issues the backend removal.
//! * **Paths are UTF-16.** WinFSP hands `PWSTR`s using backslash separators
//!   (`\foo\bar`). We convert via `OsStringExt::from_wide`, then swap
//!   backslashes for forward slashes before calling the adapter (whose
//!   trait uses POSIX-style paths).
//! * **Timestamps are Windows FILETIME** (100-ns ticks since 1601). See
//!   [`super::winfsp_ffi::unix_nanos_to_filetime`].
//! * **Alternate Data Streams / reparse points: NOT supported.** The
//!   corresponding WinFSP callbacks (where present) return
//!   `STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED` (`0xC00000BB`).
//!
//! # Security posture
//!
//! * The DLL is loaded from the system search path only (no user-controlled
//!   override) so an attacker cannot silently substitute a malicious
//!   `winfsp-x64.dll`.
//! * We never log `PWSTR` contents verbatim (paths may contain secrets in
//!   names); structured error reporting only.
//! * `allow_other` stays rejected on the Windows path as well: Windows ACL
//!   enforcement is left to the default mount descriptor.

// Declare the FFI sibling module without requiring changes to
// `platform/mod.rs` (the caller is not allowed to touch that file).
// `#[allow(missing_docs)]` — same rationale as the parent windows
// module: WinFSP FFI structs mirror upstream C headers; per-field docs
// would duplicate the upstream content. Relaxed until Tier-2 promotion.

/// Windows ACL semantics (DACL/SACL/Owner/Group with per-ACE access masks
/// and inheritance flags) do not map onto pCloud's server-side permission
/// model, which is limited to:
///
///   * sharing rules (per-folder shared contact / email),
///   * business-team ACLs (coarse-grained, not per-user),
///   * public-link visibility flags,
///   * crypto-folder private-key gating.
///
/// There is no round-trip-safe translation from an arbitrary NT
/// SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR to any combination of the above, so mirroring the
/// descriptor back to pCloud would either:
///
///   1. silently drop most of the semantics (misleading to the user who
///      set the ACL in Explorer),
///   2. reject any non-trivial descriptor (breaks Explorer's property
///      sheet even for reads), or
///   3. persist the descriptor locally only (misleading again — the ACL
///      wouldn't survive another mount).
///
/// We therefore acknowledge the request so the Explorer property sheet
/// closes cleanly, but we deliberately do not persist anything. The
/// authoritative descriptor is still synthesised by
/// [`cb_get_security_by_name`] from the current process SID + "full
/// access" SDDL. The legacy C client behaves the same way.
