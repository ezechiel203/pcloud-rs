//! FUSE adapter traits and the 4.b `ProtoFuseAdapter` implementation.
//!
//! The 4.a sub-bead landed the [`FuseAdapter`] trait and a [`NullFuseAdapter`]
//! that returns `ENOSYS` for everything. 4.b (this file) adds:
//!
//! - [`ProtoFuseAdapter`]: a concrete adapter wired to a [`FolderBackend`]
//!   and the [`InodeTable`]/[`MetadataCache`] from sibling modules.
//! - Implementations of `lookup`, `getattr`, and `readdir` that transform
//!   listing results into `EntryAttr`/`DirEntry` values and honour the
//!   metadata cache TTL.
//!
//! Read (`open`/`read`/`release`), write, rename, unlink, and truncate are
//! explicitly out of scope for 4.b. They remain at the trait-default
//! `ENOSYS` reply and will be wired in 4.c–4.e.
