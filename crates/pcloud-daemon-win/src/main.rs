//! # pcloud-daemon-win
//!
//! **Platform:** Windows only.
//!
//! `pcloudd-svc` is a thin Windows Service wrapper around the
//! `pcloud_daemon` runtime. When installed via `sc.exe` (see the
//! crate's `README.md`) the Service Control Manager (SCM) invokes this
//! binary, which hands control to the `windows_service`
//! `service_dispatcher` so the process runs under SCM supervision.
//!
//! ## Cross-compile behavior
//!
//! The crate is deliberately gated with `#[cfg(windows)]`:
//!
//! - On **Windows** targets, the full service implementation
//!   (`mod svc`) is compiled: it registers a control handler with the
//!   SCM, reports `Running` → `StopPending` → `Stopped` state
//!   transitions, and coordinates a cooperative shutdown via an
//!   `Arc<AtomicBool>` (see [`std::sync::atomic::AtomicBool`]) flag.
//! - On **non-Windows** targets (Linux, macOS, BSDs) the real service
//!   logic is elided entirely. The top-level `main()` becomes a no-op
//!   stub so `cargo check --workspace` and `cargo build --workspace`
//!   succeed on every supported host platform without producing a
//!   meaningful binary. Running the stub on a non-Windows host does
//!   nothing and exits with status `0`.
//!
//! This means the binary is only **functional** on Windows — attempting
//! to run it under Linux/macOS is a no-op by design, not a bug. Tests
//! that need the real service surface must either run on Windows or use
//! a feature-gated mock.
//!
//! ## Shutdown protocol
//!
//! The SCM control handler and the main service thread share an
//! `Arc<AtomicBool>` shutdown flag. When the SCM delivers
//! `ServiceControl::Stop` or `ServiceControl::Shutdown`, the handler
//! flips the flag to `true`; the main service thread polls the flag and
//! transitions to `StopPending` → `Stopped` once it observes the
//! request. This keeps the control handler non-blocking, as required by
//! SCM, while still giving the worker thread a chance to unwind
//! cleanly.
//!
//! The ordered state machine reported to the SCM is:
//!
//! 1. `Running` with `controls_accepted = STOP | SHUTDOWN`
//! 2. `StopPending` with `wait_hint = 5s` once the shutdown flag flips
//!    or the worker thread finishes
//! 3. `Stopped` with `exit_code = Win32(0)` after a clean stop, or a
//!    service-specific non-zero code when bootstrap/request handling
//!    fails or the worker thread panics
//!
//! The flag uses [`std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst`] on both the
//! store (handler) and the load (worker poll). That is deliberately
//! conservative — the flag is touched at most a few times per process
//! lifetime, so the cost of the strongest ordering is irrelevant, and
//! SeqCst removes any question about handler-to-worker visibility
//! across the SCM thread boundary.
//!
//! ## Cooperative `pcloud_daemon::serve_with_shutdown` entry point
//!
//! The worker now calls the cooperative entry
//! `pcloud_daemon::serve_with_shutdown`, which takes the same
//! `Arc<AtomicBool>` the SCM control handler flips. The daemon's IPC
//! serve loop polls that flag on every iteration and returns cleanly
//! once it flips, so the worker thread joins normally on SCM
//! `Stop` / `Shutdown` instead of being detached.
//!
//! Expected signature:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use std::sync::atomic::AtomicBool;
//!
//! /// Run the daemon until `shutdown` becomes `true`, then return.
//! pub fn serve_with_shutdown(shutdown: Arc<AtomicBool>) -> anyhow::Result<()>;
//! ```

/// Non-Windows entry point: no-op stub.
///
/// This function is compiled on every target that is **not** Windows.
/// It exists purely to let the workspace build cleanly on Linux and
/// macOS hosts; it performs no work and exits with status `0`. See the
/// crate-level docs for the cross-compile rationale.
///
/// # Why a stub instead of `#![cfg(windows)] compile_error!`?
///
/// The Rust workspace is built and tested on Linux as the primary CI
/// target. A `compile_error!` on non-Windows would break
/// `cargo build --workspace` / `cargo check --workspace` on every
/// developer machine and every CI runner. An empty `main` keeps the
/// workspace green while still producing a binary that is clearly a
/// no-op when executed on the wrong OS: running it prints nothing and
/// returns `0`, which is the correct behaviour for a service shim
/// that cannot possibly attach to a non-existent Service Control
/// Manager.
///
/// All real service logic lives behind [`mod svc`], which is itself
/// `#[cfg(windows)]`-gated, so the non-Windows binary contains zero
/// Windows-specific code and zero `windows_service` dependencies at
/// runtime.
