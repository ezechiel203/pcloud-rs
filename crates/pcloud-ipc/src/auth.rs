//! # IPC peer identity
//!
//! **PLATFORM: all.**
//! **GATING: none — this module defines the portable [`PeerIdentity`]
//! value type and the `current_effective_uid()` helper. Peer-credential
//! *recovery* is platform-specific and lives in [`crate::platform`]:
//! Linux → `SO_PEERCRED`, BSD/macOS → `getpeereid`, Windows → named pipe
//! TokenUser SID check.**
//!
//! `current_effective_uid()` uses `libc::geteuid` and compiles on any
//! Unix target. Windows authorization is completed by the native named-pipe
//! backend before it constructs a [`PeerIdentity`]; the legacy `uid` field is
//! therefore the sentinel `0` there, while `pid` retains the authenticated
//! client process id for audit correlation.
