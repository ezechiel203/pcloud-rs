#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! # pcloud-crypto
//!
//! Active crypto subsystem for the Rust pcloud-rs path.
//!
//! ## Security posture
//!
//! - Master key material is wrapped in [`pcloud_secret::secret_bytes::SecretBytes`]
//!   and is zeroized on drop.
//! - No password, no derived key, and no content key is ever persisted on
//!   disk by this crate. Only a non-secret setup fingerprint is stored so
//!   that the wrong start-password can be rejected without ever touching
//!   ciphertext.
//! - All encrypted-content / encrypted-name operations are gated by the
//!   active [`state::UnlockState`]. When locked, the crate returns
//!   [`CryptoError::Locked`] rather than returning plaintext.
//! - The policy surface (see [`policy::CryptoPolicy`]) rejects any
//!   configuration that would persist master key material.
//!
//! ## Parity with the C client
//!
//! The functions below correspond to the retained C API in
//! `pclsync/pcryptofolder.c` / `pclsync/psynclib.h`:
//!
//! | C symbol                                | Rust equivalent                                  |
//! |-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|

//! | `psync_crypto_start`                    | [`CryptoShell::start`]                           |
//! | `psync_crypto_stop`                     | [`CryptoShell::stop`]                            |
//! | `psync_crypto_isstarted`                | [`CryptoShell::is_started`]                      |
//! | `psync_crypto_issetup`                  | [`CryptoShell::is_setup`]                        |
//! | `psync_crypto_reset`                    | [`CryptoShell::reset`]                           |
//! | `psync_crypto_mkdir`                    | [`CryptoShell::mkdir`]                           |
//! | `pcryptofolder_fileencoder_get` (sector)| [`content::seal_sector`] / [`content::open_sector`] |
//!
//! Retained-but-not-yet-mirrored C behaviour (change password / remote
//! encoded-key exchange / team crypto) is tracked in the parity matrix and
//! intentionally omitted from the active Rust path until the transport and
//! account surfaces are ready.
